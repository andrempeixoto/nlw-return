# SOLID

1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Open/Closed Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle

---

1. Each class/function has one only responsibility;
2. Classes/functions of an application must be open for extension, and closed for modification;
3. We must be able to substitute a parent class by one that inherits from it and everything should
   continue working;
4. A class should implement interfaces that follow principle 1;
5. A class/function should not depend on external sources, but these should be passed to it.
